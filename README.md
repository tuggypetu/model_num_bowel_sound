# Deep Learning for Bowel Sound Classification in Medical Diagnosis

• This model detects the sickness of the patient from the audio file uploaded by the user that contains bowel sounds.

• The model built from scratch through various research for application with hospital associated with James Cook University. Our client was a professor from the university.

• Deep learning **Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)** model to predict bowel sounds in audio files with the help of article.

• Libraries used: tensorflow, numpy, librosa.

• Sound Analysis done with short time fourier transform, amplitude to decibel, fast fourier transform, hann window. Spectograms visualized for bowel sound files.

• Model results- accuracy: 0.97, precision: 0.83, sensitivity: 0.70, specificity: 0.99.
